# Important Note on File Formatting
This Python file was created using the Pydroid 3 mobile IDE. Due to potential differences in line endings and whitespace handling between mobile and desktop environments, you may encounter minor formatting issues when opening this file on a standard desktop code editor.
If you experience any issues with indentation or line breaks, a simple reformatting using your IDE's built-in tools should resolve them.  This won't affect the code's functionality.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and thank you for your understanding! üôè
